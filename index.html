            She just wants to be beautiful<br/>
            She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits<br/>
            She craves attention, she praises an image<br/>
            She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor<br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content1">
            Oh, she don't see the light that's shining<br/>
            Deeper than the eyes can find it<br/>
            Maybe we have made her blind<br/>
            So she tries to cover up her pain<br/>
            And cut her woes away<br/>
            'Cause cover-girls don't cry<br/>
            After their face is made<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content2">
            But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark<br/>
            You should know you're beautiful just the way you are<br/>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br/>
            The world could change its heart<br/>
            No scars to your beautiful<br/>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content3">
            Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content4">
            And you don't have to change a thing<br/>
            The world could change its heart<br/>
            No scars to your beautiful<br/>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content1">
            She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving<br/>
            You know, "Cover-girls eat nothing"<br/>
            She says, "Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"<br/>
            "What's a little bit of hunger?"<br/>
            "I can go a little while longer," she fades away<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content5">
            She don't see her perfect<br/>
            She don't understand she's worth it<br/>
            Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface<br/>
            Ah, oh, ah, ah oh<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="content6">
            So to all the girls that's hurting<br/>
            Let me be your mirror<br/>
            Help you see a little bit clearer<br/>
            The light that shines within<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            </div>

            No better you than the you that you are<br/>
            (No better you than the you that you are)<br/>
            No better life than the life we're living<br/>
            (No better life than the life we're living)<br/>
            No better time for your shine, you're a star<br/>
            (No better time for your shine, you're a star)<br/>
